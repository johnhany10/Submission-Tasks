## 🧠 What Was New for Me and How I Approached It

- It was my **first time using React**.
- I learned about core concepts like **JSX**, **hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`), and how to **fetch data using Axios**.
- I followed a **React crash course** to build a basic understanding.
- I experimented and learned through **hands-on practice and AI assistance**.
- I deployed the project using **Vercel**, which gave me experience with **hosting and deployment**.
